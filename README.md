# Mahjong

Personal project to implement Mahjong; I wanted to play with my friends.

Still in very rough stages, but the framework is there. Players can log in, join a table, and play through a game. It's pretty much functional with the exception of a few bugs here and there.

It's currently hosted on [Heroku](https://buggy-mj.herokuapp.com/#/).
